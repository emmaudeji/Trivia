# Trivia_Api

This contains my project on API and TDD. It is part of my projects at Alx-T/Udacity Full-stack Nanodegree program. It demonstrates my knowledge of RESTFUL API.

### Task - Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.

That's where you come in! Help them finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application must:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

Completing this trivia app will give you the ability to structure plan, implement, and test an API - skills essential for enabling your future applications to communicate with others.

## Starting the project

1. Clone the repo to your device.
2. From the backend directory, create a virtual environment and set the required environment variables.
3. Start the backend server using `flask run --reload`
4. Run another terminal session. In the frontend directory, run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
5. Finally, start the frontend server using `npm start`
6. You can view the website by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

See more details on how to run the app.
